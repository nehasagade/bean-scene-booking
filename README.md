# BeanSceneBookings
## Scenario
Restaurant Bean Scene had a paper-based booking and ordering system. As part of the Diploma of IT (Advanced Programming), I developed 2 apps as part of the solution for Bean Scene - this web app for restaurant bookings and a mobile app for managing orders. 

## Tech & Tools
- ASP .NET Core MVC web app with Entity Framework
- SQL Server
- Azure DevOps for source code and task management
- Deployed using Azure resources

## To Run
If there aren't any database files attached, open the project in Visual Studio, and run the update-database command in the Package Manager console.
